							<h3>Our Vision</h3>
							<p>Christ Embassy is not just a local assembly; it’s a vision. The Lord has called us to fulfill a very definite purpose, which is to take His divine presence to the peoples and nations of the world, and to demonstrate the character of His Spirit everywhere</p>
							<p>When you worship with us, you learn more than just the letters of the Word; you’re imparted with and impacted by the Spirit of the Word. As we share God’s Word, it takes root in you, and you become exactly what the Lord wants you to be. The Holy Spirit gets a hold of your life, and His vision becomes real to you and in your life. </p>

							<p>What’s more, the Lord’s influence in your life overflows to others as they watch the Word of God manifested in your life every day. </p>
							<p>Christ Embassy is a wonderful family of God’s loving people; we’re large enough to accommodate you, yet small enough to know you and minister to your most personal needs. In Christ Embassy, we give lives a meaning, and we build a happier world with the love of Christ that has so lavishly been bestowed on us. </p>
